RESTful API developed in Java with Spring Boot, using the hexagonal architecture (Ports & Adapters). It simulates a credit card management system, allowing operations such as registration, listing, updating and deleting cards.

The architecture was designed to promote decoupling between business rules and external frameworks, facilitating testing, maintenance and application evolution.
